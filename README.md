**After making changes to renderer.js hit Ctrl+R in app window to reload manually**
There is no hot reloading. This is a minimal boilerplate code that will just get you started.

`**IMPORTANT** Everytime you change something (in any js file) you have to change something in render.js( type something then comment it out) and hit Ctrl+ R to recompile everything `
